        <p>Hello, welcome to your Christmas Scavenger hunt. I have hidden clues around the house that once solved, contain the code to open the lock on your present.

            You're probably thinking, well I can just cut the string around this , but I spent a long time coding this so you better not.
            
            You may ask for help one time if you need to. If you dont know an answer, well then Christmas is ruined.
            
            You may think to yourself why you have to go through all this trouble, but that you don't really have anything else to do anyway, so why not?
            
            Time to get up and hunt. Best of luck.*Insert evil laugh* </p>
